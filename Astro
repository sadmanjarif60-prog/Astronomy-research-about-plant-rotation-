 This project presents an independent astronomy research study exploring how planetary rotation 
affects day length, surface gravity, and planetary properties. Planetary rotation is the spinning of a 
planet around its axis, which influences the duration of a day and generates centrifugal force that 
slightly modifies gravity at the equator. This study focuses on  planets  rotation.
planetary rotation is the spinning of a planet around it�s axis.The sun had strong gravity when plane
ts formed, they were already moving forward.The sun gravity pulls them  inward but their forward ro
tation keeps them moving.All planets of the galaxy around sun spinning anticlockwise.But Venus or 
Venus are different. scientest said that Venus rotation is occured by a asteroid.But my research said
 it is occured by sun gravity  .My research said that all planets around sun will change their rotation 
angel.Earth, March, Saturn, Neptune , Neptune  will change their rotation to 0°.Amomg them earth 
will change first  then march.Mercury or Uranus will change to 180°.when Saturn will change their 
rotation, Saturn ring will destroy or it will hit Neptune.Then Neptune will out off its orbit .It will hit 
asteroid belt .This asteroid will hit forward planets
